============

Project to do some analysis on Jimi Hendrix Data. 

This is the first project, so i'll be defining an architecture that we can re-use and expand for other projects. 

The main elements are: 

Data / Collection method

    Wikipedia           Python - Beautifulsoup
    RSS & Atom Feeds    Python - Feedreaded
    Twitter             Python - native code 
    
Storage

    Graph Database      Neo4j (of course!)
    
Visualization

    Charts/Networks     D2.js
